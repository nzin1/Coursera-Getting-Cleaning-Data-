Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================
### Overview
This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Modifications to Files
The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.
Once you have obtained and unzipped the source files, you will need to set the path of the working directory to reflect the location of the source files in your own directory

### Additional Information
`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called `averages_data.txt`, and uploaded in the course project's form.
